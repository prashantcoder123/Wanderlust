🌍 Wanderlust – Travel Listings Web App

Wanderlust is a Full Stack Web Application built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, and EJS that allows users to explore, create, and manage travel listings.
The app follows a modular MVC structure with Express Router for clean route separation and includes Passport.js authentication (Signup/Login/Logout) with secure session management.
Media files are uploaded and managed via Cloudinary, ensuring optimized cloud storage instead of local storage. The backend includes robust middleware for error handling, logging, and route protection, while the root path redirects to listings for smooth navigation.
The app is fully deployed on Render, making it accessible online for real-world usage.

🔹 Features: Secure authentication, add/view/edit/delete listings, cloud-based image upload, responsive EJS templates, session handling, and smooth deployment on Render.

🔹 Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, Cloudinary, Passport.js, EJS, MVC Architecture, Render Deployment.
